#Trick 1 - Conditional Selection of Rows

# The conditional selection of rows can be based on a single condition or multiple conditions in a single statement separated by logical operators.

import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('loan_train.csv')
print(data[['Education', 'ApplicantIncome']].head())

print('\n\nConditional Selection of Rows\n\n')

data_2 = data.loc[(data['Education'] == 'Not Graduate') & (data['ApplicantIncome'] <= 5400)]

print('\n\nFiltered Data\n\n')
print(data_2[['Education', 'ApplicantIncome']].head())
